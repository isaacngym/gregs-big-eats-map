# Greg's Big Eats map
## Who?
Greg is a HungryGoWhere video editor who makes videos about hawker food in Singapore.
## What?
I like Greg's Big Eats. It's [this](https://www.youtube.com/user/glblues) youtube series where he reviews food from hawker centres in Singapore and talks about the history of the shops.
## Where?
That's the exact question I'm trying to answer, where are all these places he's eating at?
## Why?
I want to eat all the things. 

Also I may want to use the data in a travelling salesman problem? That would be fun.
## When?
I'm not sure when the series started, to be frank. We'll see over the course of this project, most likely.
## How?
Scraping all his videos. At the time of writing that's 115. Hopefully I can accelerate some of the text recognition with regex? I'm not sure how well NLP would work.
